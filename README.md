# Lingua Machina

---

## What is that ?

Well, first, welcome to the *specification* of the **Lingua Machina** programming language!

The goal of this repository is to document the syntax and the implementation independent behaviors of the language.

## Show me the specs!

The explanation of the syntax of the language is available [here](syntax.md).

A draft about the module system can be found [here](modules.md).

Some examples can be found [here](code-examples.md).
